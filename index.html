		<div id="intro">
My name is Spencer Eklund, and for the last three years I've been a middle school science teacher. I've always loved teaching, but I decided I needed to move to a more financially sound career, so I've decided to take up coding. This webpage is meant to help me practice different HTML and CSS skills. </p>
